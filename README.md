# A CLI Calculator Written in Kotlin #

This is my standard _getting to know a language_ task, a CLI calculator.
This project uses `gradle` as the build program.

## The Calculator ##

The calculator supports all four arithmetic operations, exponentiation via `^`,
exponential and logarithmic functions, trignometric functions,
constants&mdash;`pi` and `e`, and assigning numbers to variables. A blank input
ends the REPL.
